## Dealing
  * Dealer didn't hit a soft 17? TBD

## Events
  * Desperately need dynamic button actuation/enablement/disablement

## User Expierence thoughts
  * Should we have the double last bet option? Yes
    - But default to 0 still.. remember last bet (somehow), and double/place it + deal

## Testing
  * May need to generate some predefined single card decks to aid testing of split aces and such....
