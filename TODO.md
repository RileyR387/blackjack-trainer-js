## Dealing
  * Need to convert `bjg.dealHands()` to `bjg.dealRound`, clear table and start next round when a bet is manuplated
  * Above will give you time to see the dealers result (and your own result, outside of the bankroll changes)

## Events
  * Desperately need dynamic button actuation/enablement/disablement

## User Expierence thoughts
  * Really need to show the current hand being played upon - also aids in error searching
  * Should we have the double last bet option? Yes
    - But default to 0 still.. remember last bet (somehow), and double/place it + deal

## Testing
  * May need to generate some predefined single card decks to aid testing of split aces and such....
