## Dealing
  * Dealer didn't hit a soft 17? 
  * Handle Insurance
  * Even if no one takes insurance... detect the dealer blackjack. Big problem...

## Events
  * Scope doesn't apply to update current play CSS while taking bets, visible when seated outside of the first position

## User Expierence
  * Need to show shoe progression
  * Need to indicate shoe shuffle as well
  * If you manage to zoom in mobile safari.. probably need to reset game to zoom out.. Happened once, could be cashed junk. TBD.

## AI Players
  * Need to author/perfect them... Still trivial dealer style play and default bets

## Testing
  * Could be automated some, but likely not worth the effort... Would likely need predfined decks
