# blackjack-trainer-js
Blackjack trainer with optional AI seating placement. 
I couldn't find a free game that offered multiple seats or AI player personalities, so I'm making one!

Primary goal is to mimic a real blackjack game 100% with additional training tools enabled optionally.

Porting from my terminal based blackjack game [blackjack-ai-py](https://github.com/RileyR387/blackjack-ai-py).

### Dev Environment
```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Build
```shell
npm i
# runs live server locally using minified sources
npm run start
```
